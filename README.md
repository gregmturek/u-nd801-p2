# Popular Movies

This is an Android app for movie information that I developed as a project for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. It features tabs displaying lists of most popular and top rated movies as well as a tab for movies selected as favorites. Tapping on a movie poster opens a new page with more content, including a synopsis, reviews, and trailers. In addition to the project requirements, I added a search feature, links, and a custom layout library for YouTube.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and import it into Android Studio.
2. Create an account at [www.themoviedb.org](www.themoviedb.org) and get an API key by clicking the _API_ link on the sidebar from within your account settings page.
3. Add the following line to your global gradle.properties file: `MyTheMovieDatabaseApiKey="replace_this_with_your_key"`
